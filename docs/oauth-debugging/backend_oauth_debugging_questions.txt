BACKEND OAUTH DEBUGGING QUESTIONS
=====================================

Based on the console logs, the user is being redirected to "/login" with no OAuth parameters, 
which indicates the backend OAuth flow is not working correctly. Please provide the following information:

1. GOOGLE OAUTH ENDPOINTS
-------------------------
- What is the exact URL for initiating Google OAuth? (e.g., GET /api/oauth/google)
- What is the exact callback URL configured in the backend? (e.g., GET /api/oauth/google/callback)
- What parameters does the initiate endpoint accept? (type=landing/admin, etc.)

2. GOOGLE CONSOLE CONFIGURATION
-------------------------------
- What redirect URI is configured in the Google OAuth Console?
- Is it exactly: http://localhost:5000/api/oauth/google/callback?
- Are there any other redirect URIs configured?

3. BACKEND OAUTH FLOW
---------------------
When a user clicks "Continue with Google":
- Frontend redirects to: http://localhost:5000/api/oauth/google?type=landing
- Where does the backend redirect the user after Google authentication?
- What URL format does the backend use for success redirects?
- What parameters does it include? (token, is_new, error, etc.)

4. BACKEND LOGS
---------------
When testing the OAuth flow, please check backend logs for:
- Are OAuth requests reaching the backend?
- Any errors during Google OAuth processing?
- What URL is the backend trying to redirect to after successful OAuth?
- Any 404 errors or routing issues?

5. BACKEND OAUTH SUCCESS RESPONSE
----------------------------------
After successful Google authentication, what does the backend do?
- Does it redirect to a frontend URL with query parameters?
- What is the exact redirect URL format? (e.g., http://localhost:3000/auth/callback?token=xxx&is_new=true)
- Or does it redirect to /login on error?

6. BACKEND ERROR HANDLING
-------------------------
If OAuth fails, where does the backend redirect?
- Does it redirect to /login?
- Does it include error parameters?
- What triggers a redirect to /login?

7. BACKEND OAUTH STATE
----------------------
- Is the backend properly handling OAuth state parameters?
- Are CSRF tokens being validated correctly?
- Any session/cookie issues?

8. QUICK TEST REQUEST
--------------------
Can you test this exact flow and share the logs:
1. Visit: http://localhost:5000/api/oauth/google?type=landing
2. Complete Google OAuth
3. Check what URL you end up on
4. Share backend logs from this test

CURRENT ISSUE SUMMARY:
- User clicks "Continue with Google" 
- Gets redirected somewhere in the OAuth flow
- Ends up on http://localhost:3000/login with no parameters
- No token, no error, no OAuth data - just a clean /login page

This suggests the backend is redirecting to /login instead of a proper callback URL with OAuth parameters.
